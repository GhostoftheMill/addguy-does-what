//When planner is open it displays current day at top of planner

//Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future (already in CSS)

//When I click on a time block, I can enter an event

//When I click the save button the text is saved in local storage

//When I refresh the page the saved events persist
